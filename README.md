# Reinforcement Learning Baselines

This is an implementation of popular Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in PyTorch.
The aim is to keep it modular and serve as the go to reference implementation.

## Algorithms Implemented

Most of these will require architectural and hyper-parameter changes. However, rest of
the setup is the same.

* DQN
* A2C
